# GoProject
This Go program reads multiple log files at the same time, finds lines with the word "ERROR", and writes them into one file called errors.log. Each error line includes the name of the file it came from.  ✅ Uses goroutines, channels, and WaitGroups for concurrency. ✅ Fast and efficient for large server logs.
